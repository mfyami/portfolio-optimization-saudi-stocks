Built an optimized investment portfolio using Excel and the Markowitz Model. Analyzed historical data for Almarai, Alhalawini, and FirstMilles to maximize returns while limiting risk (‚â§ 0.4). Used Solver to determine optimal stock allocation under constraints
 üìä Portfolio Optimization Using the Markowitz Model

This project presents a real-world application of **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** using historical stock data from three Saudi-listed companies: **Almarai**, **Alhalawini**, and **FirstMilles**. The goal is to construct an optimal investment portfolio that **maximizes returns while minimizing risk**, following Harry Markowitz‚Äôs risk-return framework.

 ## üéØ Project Objective

- Develop a stock market investment portfolio using historical stock prices.
- Apply quantitative modeling to calculate expected returns and portfolio-level risk.
- Use **Microsoft Excel + Solver** to determine optimal asset allocation.
- Ensure risk level remains under a set threshold (‚â§ 0.4).

## üß† Model Overview

The project is based on the **Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization Model**, which evaluates combinations of assets to identify an efficient frontier.

- **Decision Variable (Xm):** Fraction of total portfolio allocated to stock *m*
- **Objective Function:** Maximize expected return
- **Constraints:**
  - Portfolio risk ‚â§ 0.4
  - Xm ‚â• 0 (no short selling)

## üìÇ Project Files

- `Improved_Portfolio_Optimization_Presentation.pptx`  
  ‚Üí Professional slide deck explaining the theory, modeling steps, and results  
- `Portfolio optimization (1).xlsx`  
  ‚Üí Excel file containing:
    - Historical prices
    - Daily and average returns
    - Variance and covariance calculations
    - Solver-based optimization

## üîç Methodology Steps

1. **Data Collection:** Input historical stock prices over a given period
2. **Return Calculation:** Compute daily and average returns for each stock
3. **Risk Analysis:** Calculate daily variance and standard deviation
4. **Portfolio Modeling:** Apply weights to calculate portfolio-level return and risk
5. **Optimization:** Use **Excel Solver** to maximize expected return under the risk constraint

## üìà Outcome

- Achieved an optimized stock distribution across the three companies
- Kept the risk level within the defined threshold (‚â§ 0.4)
- Validated the use of Excel as a powerful tool for financial modeling
